Ocean3D
=======

Description
-----------

This package contains two submodules to monitor and evaluate the 3D ocean evolution and mean state:

- ``Ocean Drifts``: to characterize and monitor model drifts.
- ``Ocean Circulation``: to evaluate the realism of the model in simulating key precursors of the ocean circulation.

All these diagnostics are produced in a consistent way for any selected model simulation.
Additionally, there are newly added multi-model diagnostic functions under both submodules that
allow the comparison of different experiments at once.

Structure
---------

The ocean3d diagnostic follows a class structure and consists of the following files:

- ``cli``: Folder to run the ocean diagnostics from the command line;
    - ``cli_ocean3d.py``: a python file that contains the command line ocean diagnostics;
    - ``config.yaml``: config file containing details for the cli;

- ``config`` : Folder containing necessary information for ocean3d;
    - ``regions.yaml``: yaml file containing the predefined regions where users can also define regions;

- ``notebooks``: Folder contains notebooks demonstrating the functions;
    - ``ocean_drifts.ipynb``: an ipython notebook with examples on how to apply the ocean drift diagnostics;
    - ``ocean_circulation.ipynb``: an ipython notebook with examples on how to apply the ocean circulation diagnostics;
    - ``multi_model_analysis.ipynb``: an ipython notebook with examples on how to apply the multi model diagnostics;

- ``ocean3d``: Folder containing the ocean3d functions;
    - ``ocean_circulation``: Folder containing the ocean circulation functions;
        - ``multi_model``: Folder containing the ocean circulation functions;
        - ``mld.py``: a python file that contains the functions for mixed layer depth;
        - ``stratification.py``: a python file that contains the functions for stratification;
    - ``ocean_drifts``: Folder containing the ocean drift functions;
        - ``multi_model``: Folder containing the ocean drift functions;
        - ``hovmoller_plot.py``: a python file that contains the functions for hovmoller plot;
        - ``time_series.py``: a python file that contains the functions for time series;
        - ``trends.py``: a python file that contains the functions for trends;
    - ``ocean_utils.py``: a python file that contains functions used in both ocean3d diagnostic modules;

- ``README.md``: a readme file that contains some technical information on how to install the ocean3d diagnostic and its environment. 

Input variables example
-----------------------

* ``avg_thetao`` (Ocean potential temperature, GRIB paramid 150129)
* ``avg_so``     (Sea water practical salinity, GRIB paramid 151130)

Output 
------

This module exports all the data and diagnostics used to create the different figures except the multi-model diagnostics.

CLI (Command Line Interface) 
------------------------------

Under the cli folder, upon updating the config file and running the cli_ocean3d.py, users will generate all the ocean3d diagnostics figures. 

.. code-block:: bash

    python cli_ocean3d.py --model <model> --exp <experiment> --source <source> 


The CLI accepts the following arguments:

- ``--catalog``: the catalog to analyze.
- ``--model``: the model to analyze.
- ``--exp``: the experiment to analyze.
- ``--source``: the source to analyze.
- ``--config``: path to the configuration file.
- ``--cluster``: run the diagnostic on a dask cluster already existing (used by aqua-analysis).
- ``-l`` or ``--loglevel``: log level for the logger. Default is WARNING.
- ``-n`` or ``--nworkers``: number of dask workers for parallel computation.
- ``--outputdir``: path to the output folder.
- ``--regrid``: Target grid for regridding.


Prepare the o3d request
---------------------------

Single Model analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ocean3d`` typical request looks like this, but some details may change depending on the selected function.
Also, the requests for multi-model diagnostics are also different. 
We recommend to look into the notebooks to get a clearer idea of function-specific details. 

.. code-block:: python

    o3d_request= {'model':'IFS-NEMO', 'exp':'historical-1990', 'source': 'lra-r100-monthly',
                  'data': data, 'obs_data': obs_data, 'region':'Labrador Sea',
                  'latS':None, 'latN':None, 'lonW':None, 'lonE':None,
                  'output':True, "time" : "February", 'output_dir':'./output'}

Multi Model analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For multi-model analysis, the request looks like this, but some details may change depending on the selected function.
We recommend looking into the notebooks to get a clearer idea of function-specific details. 

.. code-block:: python

    data_dict = {'EN4 1':en4_1, 'EN4 2':en4_2, 'IFS-NEMO Historical':ifs_nemo_historical,
                 'IFS-NEMO ssp370':ifs_nemo_ssp370,
                 'icon Historical':icon_historical,'icon ssp370': icon_ssp370} 
    o3d_request= {'data_dict': data_dict,'region':'Labrador Gin Seas',
                  'latS':None,'latN':None,'lonW':None,'lonE':None,
                  'output':True,"time" : "March",'output_dir':'./output'}

Methods used 
------------

- All regional averages have been produced with area weights.
- Temporal trends are computed as linear trends and estimated over the whole temporal span of the dataset.
- The mixed layer depth is computed by the function ``compute_mld_cont`` from ``sigma0`` monthly fields following the criteria from de Boyer Montegut et al (2004)
- Density fields are computed from absolute salinity and conservative temperature fields using the TEOS-10 equations.
- Absolute salinity and conservative temperature are also computed from practical salinity and potential temperature fields with TEOS-10 equations.


Observations  
---------------

EN4.2.2.g10 ocpt and so observations for the period 1950-2022
