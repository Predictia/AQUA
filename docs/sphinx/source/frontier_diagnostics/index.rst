Frontier diagnostics
====================

This list includes diagnostics which will provide novel insight on specific climate phenomena which cannot be resolved or studied 
in the current generation of global climate models configured at standard resolutions. 

The goal of most of these diagnostics is not to make an assessment about the quality 
of the simulations or to compare them against existing simulations,
but rather to demonstrate the scientific and technical possibilities
offered by the new high-resolution data. 
Most importantly, they will work directly on the full temporal and/or spatial resolution of the climate models. 

Currently implemented diagnostics are:

   :maxdepth: 1
   
   ssh_variability
   tropical_cyclones
   tropical-rainfall
