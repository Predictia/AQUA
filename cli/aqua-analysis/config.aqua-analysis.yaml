    # The max_threads variable serves as a mechanism to control the maximum number of threads
    # i.e. diagnostic scripts that can run concurrently.
    # - If max_threads is set to 0 or a negative value: There is no limit on the number of threads,
    #                                                   and all processes run in parallel without waiting. 
    #                                                   This is suitable for situations where you want to utilize
    #                                                   the maximum available resources without any restrictions.
    # - If max_threads is set to a positive value: It limits the number of concurrent threads to the specified value. 
    #                                              After launching the designated number of threads, the script waits
    #                                              for these threads to complete before launching additional ones. 
    #                                              This is useful when you are working on a system with limitations

  #    nworkers: the number of workers to use for the diagnostic if a global dask cluster is not used. Default is 1.
  #              Notice: these are still provided mostly for testing the local cluster option, using a global cluster (not using this option) is the new default.
  #    extra: extra command line arguments to pass to the diagnostic script.
  #    outname: the name of the output directory for the diagnostic. Default is the diagnostic name itself.
  #    script_path: the location of the script to run the diagnostic.
  #                 Default script_path is "$script_path_base/$diagnostic/cli/cli_${diagnostic}.py"
  #    nocluster: boolean, if set to true, the diagnostic will not use the global dask cluster. Default false (needed for ECmean)
