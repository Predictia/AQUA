## Installation Instructions

To install this diagnostic you can use conda.

No more environments than the regular AQUA ones (located in `./environment.yaml`) are needed.
Refer to the AQUA documentation for more information.

## Data requirements

The ensemble members with `1D`,`2D` in `lon-lat` or `lev-lat` dimensions needs merged along the default dimension `Ensembles` to create an `xarray.Dataset`. This `xarray.Dataset` is then given to the `ensemble` module. 

## Examples

The `notebooks` folder contains notebooks with examples of how to use the ensemble module and its main functions.
Please note that notebooks may load data from the DKRZ cluster, so they may not work outside of levante.
